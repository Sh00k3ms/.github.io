  <h1>🕵️ Under the Hood CTF: How to Hack the Stack (Without Losing Your Mind)</h1>
  <p>Welcome, hacker. If you’ve found yourself here, odds are you’ve either:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Been handed a strange-looking sticker with a QR code,</li>
    <li>Clicked something you maybe weren’t supposed to,</li>
    <li>Or you're trying to track down the elusive <strong>Grifter</strong>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Either way? Respect.</p>
  <p>This writeup walks through the logic behind each phase of the <strong>Under the Hood CTF</strong>, but won’t spoil it all outright. Think of it more like a hacker's field journal — with nudges, hints, and a bit of Defcon lore.</p>

  <div class="phase">
    <h2>Phase 1: Cipher Warmup 🔓</h2>
    <p>You’re greeted with a classic cipher challenge. If you’ve got even half a cryptographer’s brain, you’ll recognize what kind of shift is going on here. Think ROT, think Caesar. Easy start — don’t overthink it.</p>
    <p class="hint">🧠 <strong>Hint</strong>: If A = D, what happened?</p>
  </div>

  <div class="phase">
    <h2>Phase 2: Headers Up 🧠</h2>
    <p>Here you’ll need to inspect what the server is really saying — not just what the browser displays. It’s hiding in plain sight.</p>
    <p class="hint">🧠 <strong>Hint</strong>: Dev tools are your best friend. Check the headers.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="phase">
    <h2>Phase 3: Symbol of the Hackers ⚙️</h2>
    <p>This is about hacker culture. Specifically, a symbol introduced in 2003 by someone with <em>strong</em> opinions about open source.</p>
    <p class="hint">🧠 <strong>Hint</strong>: Game of Life + ESR + 5 cells = ?</p>
  </div>

  <div class="phase">
    <h2>Phase 4: Don’t Get Nabbed 💀</h2>
    <p>You’ve seen this kind of attack before, even if you didn’t know what to call it. Switch tabs, and suddenly the login page isn’t what it was. Feels fishy.</p>
    <p class="hint">🧠 <strong>Hint</strong>: You got nabbed. But what kind?</p>
  </div>

  <div class="phase">
    <h2>Phase 5: The Grifter Hunt 👒</h2>
    <p>And now… the final phase. You’ve proven your skills, but now comes the real challenge:</p>
    <blockquote><strong>Find Grifter. In real life.</strong></blockquote>
    <h3>The Lore:</h3>
    <p>Grifter is a legendary figure at DEF CON. Hard to find. Rarely stays still. That’s why his underlings (Contest Goon crew) decided to track him. Not to interfere — just to observe. You’ll need to ask <em>the right goons</em> for a tip on where he might be next.</p>
    <h3>What You’ll Need:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A working knowledge of the CTF name.</li>
      <li>Social engineering skills (lightweight — don’t be creepy).</li>
      <li>Confidence to ask a Contest Goon, “Any word on Grifter’s location?”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you find him? You’ll get a <strong>QR code</strong>.</p>
    <p>There are two:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>🏆 <strong>Winner QR</strong>: For the first to find him.</li>
      <li>🐾 <strong>Solved QR</strong>: For everyone else who still makes it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Both will log your handle — so choose it wisely.</p>
  </div>

  <footer>
    <p>This CTF wasn’t about brute force. It was about:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Paying attention.</li>
      <li>Knowing your tools.</li>
      <li>Understanding hacker culture.</li>
      <li>Asking for help at the right time.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you made it through all five phases and found Grifter in the wild? You’re part of the pack now.</p>
    <p><strong>Respect the stack. Respect the pack.</strong></p>
